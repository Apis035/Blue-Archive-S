# Blue Archive S

Blue Archive's story mode clone in Game Maker. wip.

This is a hobby project that I do for fun. This was started when I wanted to try creating a visual novel game but don't want to use already existing visual novel engine such as Ren'Py. *(Python language is bad)*

## Loading project

### Prerequisite:

- Game Maker 8
- NotoSans font installed on your system (available on [Fonts](src/Fonts/) folder)

### Building:

- Run [BuildGmk.bat](src/BuildGmk.bat) to build the `.gmk` file
- Load the `.gmk` file into Game Maker

Although this project was created in GM 8, it works too on GM 8.1. Should be able to load in GM Studio 1, but don't even try to load this on GM Studio 2.

## Other tools

Medo42's [Gmk-Splitter](https://github.com/Medo42/Gmk-Splitter) is used to enable Game Maker 8 project to use version control tool.
